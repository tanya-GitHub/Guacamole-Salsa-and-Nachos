This is a great Mexican dish that many poeple often eat as a snack. It can be easily made in an oven or microwave. It consists of a dip made from ripe avacados and chips covered in chese and vegetables. It is quite healthy and delicious. You may not find guocalome in India, as avacodos cannot tolerate the hot temperatures. Instaed, I will also show you a recipe for salsa, which is made from tomatoes. Hope you enjoy this recipe! :)
