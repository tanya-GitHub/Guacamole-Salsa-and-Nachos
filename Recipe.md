RECIPE:

Nachos:
1. If you are making your nachos in an oven, preheat it to 180 degrees C. If you are using a microwave, you may skip this step.
2. Spread your chips evenly on a baking dish. 
3. Now add your beans, chopped capcicum, chopped cucumber, and halfed olives to your chips. Try to even it out so all chips contain each ingredient.
4. Now add the grated cheese on top. 
5. If you are using an oven, once it is preheated, put your nachos in for 15 minutes or until the chese has melted. 
If you are using a microwave, put your nachos in for 1 minute, or until the cheese melts. 
6. Once the cheese has melted, take your nachos out and enjoy with your guacamole or salsa. 

Guacamole:
1. First cut your avacados through the middle and remove the seed. Using a spoon, scoop the avacado out of its skin. 
2. Put the avacados in a bowl and smash with a fork until it is the consistency you like. 
3. Once you are pleased with the concistency, chop the tomato until it is very small, and add it in with your avacados. 
4. Add the lime juice and coriander leaves, and stir with your fork. 
5. Ready, now you can enjoy your nachos with your guacamole! ;)

Salsa:
1. You may also make salsa if you don't have avacados, or want to try something new.
2. First, rougly cut all the vegetables to make the blending easier. 
3. Then, add the cut vegetables and spices in a blender. 
4. Blend everthing until it is finely chopped up. You may blend it even more if you prefer a thinner paste. 
5. Have a quick taste before serving to make sure the amount of spice is perfect. Make any adjusments needed.
6. Now your salsa is ready to eat! Enjoy!
